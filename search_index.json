People are re-inventing and duplicating code components already written before on daily basis.\nThis wastes precious time and effort which can be better invested in building new things. Components can be improved and evolved without having to start from scratch every time. Duplicating components across repositories isn't any better, as maintaining or changing a single function becomes an odyssey, and the larger the code base the worse it gets.\nUp until Bit, the only way to make components reusable was to spend too much time on boilerplating and build configuration just to end up having to maintain a git repo, a package and CI for every small component. This isn’t practical and is very hard to scale.\nTo understand the solution we turned back to the basics of writing code, as we were taught from day one. We should create independent and isolated components. We should also manage them to make this a practical practice.\nTo achieve this we designed Bit - the first code component manager. Bit is a distributed manager written in javascript yet designed to be language agnostic. It allows you to make components reusable with zero initial configuration and use these components across repositories. It also helps to store, organize and manage your components. It allows you to group your components by context, while also handling versioning, dependency management, build and test execution and more. Bit also makes components easy to find and collaborate on.\nAt the end of the day, distributed component management is deeply connected to the very basics of writing software as we want it to be.

Local scopes are created for your projects. Components exported to remote scopes can be used across projects. It's recommended to create the scope at the root of a project. You can create as many scopes as you need.\nType the following in the command line.\n\nmkdir hello-world Create an empty directory.\n\ncd hello-world\n\nbit init Initialize an empty scope.\n\n\nThis generates a bit.json file and a .bit directory.\nYou can read more about the local scope here.\nCreate a Bit component\nBit components are organized and managed in scopes. To create your first Bit component go to a project with a bit scope in it (or create one by using bit init in a directory).\n1. Create a Bit component:\nbit create is-string\nThis creates an implementation file in the inline_components directory.\n\nBit components contain a minimum of one impl.js file and may contain two additional files: spec.js and bit.json - component.\n\n2. Write the component's implementation in the impl.js file created for the component.\nopen ./inline_components/global/is-string/impl.js\nYou can copy and paste this example:\n  module.exports = function isString(val) {\n    return typeof val === 'string';\n  };\n\n\nYou can see the status of all the components in your project using: bit status.\n\nUse the Bit component in your code\n3. Install the bit-js module using NPM or Yarn.\nnpm install bit-js\n4. Create a file - touch index.js && open index.js, require bit-js module, and call the component:\nconst bit = require('bit-js');\nconst isString = bit('is-string'); // \n\nconsole.log(isString('string')); // true\nconsole.log(isString(1)); // false\n\n5. Now simply run the application node index.js.\nbit-js will resolve the component from the inline_components directory.\n\nRead more about Drivers.\n\nCommit your code\nOur goal is to use a component in our future work. Before exporting it to a remote scope, it needs to be committed from your inline_components to your local scope.\n6. bit commit is-string 'initial commit'\n\nYour component moved from the inline_components directory into the components directory. You can still use it with bit-js the same way as before.\n\nYou can view the component you just added to your scope: bit show @this/is-string\n\n@this stands for local scope notation, you can also call the scope in it's real name located in .bit/scope.json file.\n\nUse bit status to get a clear view of all components in your local scope.\n\n@this, is the local scope annotation. That means when you want to refer to your local scope, you can use @this instead the real scope name (located in the scope.json file under the .bit directory)\n\n\nSummary\n\nmkdir  && cd \nbit init\nbit create \nopen ./inline_components//impl.js // write some code in impl.js\nbit commit  'initial commit'\nSetup a Remote Scope\nCreate and use as many remote scopes as you need to distribute your code, to be later reused across projects and development teams.\nCreate a remote scope\nYou can host a scope on any POSIX machine (you can host multiple scopes on the same machine/VM). All remote communication is done over SSH.\nFollow these steps to host your own scope:\n\nVerify that bit is installed.\n\nCreate a directory on your machine. mkdir scopy && cd scopy\n\nInitialize a bare Bit scope in the new folder. bit init --bare\n\n\nThat's it, the scope is ready, next we need to register it as a remote scope.\nAdd the new scope to your remotes list\nIf you are in the scope directory use pwd | pbcopy to copy the current working directory to you clipboard.\nWe will refer it as \nIn your own development machine, use the remote command to add the new remote scope to your project.\nbit remote add file:// --global\nYou can check your registered remotes with the bit remote command.s\n\n\nYou can also add a scope from another machine via ssh.\n\nbit remote add ssh:// --global\n\nImportant note about ssh!

They also allow you to collaborate with others while using and managing your components together.\nImportant -  If you don't have a remote scope yet, please create one on Setup a remote scope\nGo back to the 'Hello-world' directory, where you first created your component and committed it. Now Export the component to the remote scope using bit export @this/is-string @scopy\n\nassuming that you created @scopy in the initial setup chapter\n\nYour component exported from the local scope, but it is still in the components directory, and available for requiring in the project. it also adds it to the bit.json file as a dependency.\n\nyou can use bit list @scopy and bit show @scopy/is-string to verify that your component exported correctly.\n\n\nsummery\n\nbit export @this/ \nImport a component\nOpen a new directory somewhere else.\nmkdir different-project && cd different-project\nCreate a new scope\nbit init\nimport the component and save it in bit.json file.\nbit import @scopy/is-string --save\nYou can see that the component was exported to the project.

Instead, it supports only incremented component versioning. For example, the first version of a component will be 1, the second will be 2 and so forth.\nLet's say we want to add documentation to the component we've just created.\n1. Import the component to the inline_bits folder:\nbit modify @scopy/is-string\nThe component is also in the staging area as you can see by typing bit status.\nWhen you'll commit it, the version will increment itself.\n2. Open the impl.jd file and make some changes. you can also copy and paste the following code.\nopen ./inline_components/global/is-string/impl.js\n\n  \n  /**\n  * determines whether `val` is a string.\n  * @param {*} val reference to test.\n  * @returns {boolean}\n  * @example\n  * ```js\n  *  isString('') // => true\n  *  isString(1) // => false\n  * ```\n  */\n  module.exports = function isString(val) {\n    return typeof val === 'string';\n  };\n  \n\n\n3.

Paste this implementation or write tests of your own:\nconst expect = require('chai').expect;\nconst isString = require(__impl__);\n\ndescribe('#isString()', () => {\n  it('should return true if `foo` is passed', () => {\n    expect(isString('foo')).to.equal(true);\n  });\n\n  it('should return false if `1` is passed', () => {\n    expect(isString(1)).to.equal(false);\n  });\n\n  it('should return false if `[]` is passed', () => {\n    expect(isString([1])).to.equal(false);\n  });\n});\n\n\nnote that the __impl__ is a reference to the impl file injected by the testing environment.\nyou can't use node modules like you would normal do, because the component should be exported to an isolated environment and run the specs there. you can only require the modules that the tester provides,\n\n6. Add the tester to the component's bit.json open ./inline_components/global/is-string/bit.json\n\nCopy and paste the following:\n\n    {\n        \"sources\": {\n            \"impl\": \"impl.js\",\n            \"spec\": \"spec.js\"\n        },\n        \"env\": {\n            \"compiler\": \"bit.envs/compilers/babel::latest\",\n            \"tester\": \"bit.envs/testers/mocha::latest\"\n        },\n        \"dependencies\": {},\n        \"packageDependencies\": {}\n    }\n7.

A code component is a testable and a reusable definition of a \ncertain atomic functionality that handles a single and a well-defiend responsibility.\nIt can be almost anything, from a function, class, object, array, string to a React or an AngularJS component.\nBit's component was designed with testability and simplicity in mind, our goal was to make it as simple as it \ngets to create, maintain, test and discover code components.\n\nCreation simplicity - \nCreating a component requires only one mandatory file which is the implementation file itself \n(tests and configration are optional). \nTranspiling, testing, docs and other boilerplate mechanics can be set using the component environment.\nMaintainable - \nAutomatic versioning, a slim built-in Scope CI mechanism \nand a dependency management mechanism designed to center performance, consistency and predictability. \nDiscoverable - \nEach component is indexed and made fully discoverable by a natural-language search that aimes to understand and cluster components by its functionality.\nSee our Scope Discoverability section for more information.\n\nComponent's Anatomy\nA Bit component's most fundamental and only mandatory file is the implementation file named impl.js (default name).\nThe implementation file consists the component implementation itself and its docs which are parsed to form \nthe entire component documantation (see Component Documentation section for more info).\nOn top of the implmantation file, two more optional files can be added:\n\nspec.js - \ncontains the component's unit tests, designated to be executed by the configured Testing Environment.\nbit.json - \nConfiguration file for handling of dependencies, environment, naming conventions and more.\n\nPlease note, component file names can be configured via bit.json, spec.js and impl.js are the default names.\nComponent Example\nimpl.js - includes the implmantation itself with its docs (later to be parsed and form the component's documantation).\n/**\n * determines whether `val` is a reference\n * @name isString\n * @param {*} val value to be tested.\n * @returns {boolean} \n * @example\n *  isString('') // => true\n**/\nmodule.exports = function isString(val) {\n  return typeof val === 'undefined';\n}\n\nspec.js - includes unit tests implmented using Mocha and Chai executed by the defined testing environment.\nimport { expect } from 'chai';\n\nconst isString = require(__impl__);\n\ndescribe('#isString()', () => {\n  it('should return false if undefined is passed', () => {\n    expect(isString()).to.equal(false);\n  });\n\n  it('should return true if string is passed', () => {\n    expect(isString('foo')).to.equal(true);\n  });\n});\n\nbit.json - configured to handle test execution with Mocha and transpiling with Babel. \n(Please note, this configuration can be specified)\n{\n    \"env\": {\n        \"compiler\": \"bit.envs/compilers/babel\", // Traspiler component for implementation and unit tests files\n        \"tester\": \"bit.envs/testers/mocha\" // Testing environment component for unit test execution\n    },\n    \"dependencies\": {\n      \"@scope/is-string\": \"1\" // specify component dependencies (they will be resolved upon export) \n    },\n    \"packageDependencies\": {\n      \"user-home\": \"^2.0.0\", // set package dependencies if needed\n    } \n}\n\nComponent ID\nBit components are universally and uniquely identified using a Bit ID to support the distributed nature of a Scope.\nWe designed the component ID to make it easy for developers to create and maintain code components without the need to resolve different naming conflicts and to enable semantic organization of code components on a Scope. \nEach Bit component has its own ID which is a composition of the scope name, namespace and name of the component.\n@/[namespace]/\nFor example, a component named string/is stored in a Scope named foo would have the following ID:\n@foo/string/is\nIn case the component's source is stored on your local scope, you can also use the @this annotation as a syntactic-sugar to reference it.\n@this/string/is\nTo reference a component which was not committed to any scope yet and exists within the inline_components directory,\njust ignore the scope name.\nstring/is\nIn this case, Bit will look for a directory named string with a component directory named is in your inline_components directory.\nA component ID may also include a specific version using the :: annotation.\nFor example, a reference to a component named is-string on Scope foo in version 2 could be done like that:\n@foo/is-string::2\nGlobal namespace\nWhen creating a component without a namespace, it will be automatically assigned to the global namespace.\nFor example, a component named is-string created without a namespace on your local scope, can be addressed in two different ways.\nExplicitly reference the global namespace\n@this/global/is-string\nImplicitly reference the global namespace to make names shorter.\n@this/is-string\nComponent Configuration\nBit components are configured via a configration file named bit.json.\nFor more information, please check out the bit.json documantation section.\nComponent Versioning\nIn Bit, versions are automatically assigned to a component once its commited (using bit commit) to a Scope using a simple and automatic versioning mechanism.\nOnce a component is commited from the inline_components directory to a Scope, Bit checks whether a version of this component exists and does one of the following:\n\nComponent exists - Bit will uptick components version by one.\nNew component (component does not exists on scope) - A new component would be created.\n\nBit handles small code component with a single responsibility, not large packages. Such components simply tend to change less often. This made us favor strict versioning over SemVer and automatic updates. We value reliability and stability.\nComponent Documentation\nDocumentation for packages is not fun, but if you want your code to be truely reuseable, other developers will need to have a place to learn how to use your code. We beleive that the best place to tell people how to use your code, is... well.. alongside your code. This way, when you distribute code components, and even open a code component to review its code, the usage instruction are there (!).\nThis is no magic. To do this, bit utilize the 'Xdoc' format for annotating everything as a part of yoru code.\nLet's take JavaScript for example.\nJavaScript uses JSDocs to create documentation on JS code. Bit knows how to read these docs, and parse them in a way that gives other users a formatted view of them, to better understand what to expect from the component before even using it.\nHow does it work in real life?\nLet's imagine a pad-left function, and write the JSdocs:\n/**\n * pad a string to the left.\n * @name leftPad\n * @param {string} str string to pad\n * @param {number} len total \n * @param {string} ch char to use for padding\n * @returns {string} modified string\n * @example\n * ```js\n *  leftPad('foo', 5) // => \"  foo\"\n *  leftPad('foobar', 6) // => \"foobar\"\n *  leftPad(1, 2, '0') // => \"01\"\n *\n\n */\n\nWhen exporting the component to a scope, Bit will parse the annotations, and create a proper documentation from it. Furthermore, Bit will use the documentation to index the component, so when searching for components, a better documented code component will be more discoverable by other users.\n\nTo view the docs for a component you can either open the code, or use the `show` command (which also works on [remote scopes](bit-scope.md)).\n\n```sh\n› bit show string/pad-left\n┌────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│ Name               │ leftPad                                          │\n├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│ Description        │ pad a string to the left.                        │\n├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│ Args               │ (str: string, len: number, ch: string)           │\n├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│ Returns            │ string -> modified string                        │\n└────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\nExamples\n\n leftPad('foo', 5) // => \"  foo\"\n leftPad('foobar', 6) // => \"foobar\"\n leftPad(1, 2, '0') // => \"01\"\nComponent Debugging\n// TODO\nComponent Environment\nMaking sure code can run everywhere is hard. To ease this process, Bit implements 'environments'.\nYou can define your code's build and test requirements. Bit will then make sure all requirements are met when using a components. Taking the load of building a boilerplate to run code from you, to Bit.\nAll environment are basically a code component that exports an API that allows Bit to either build or test a code component.\nBuild Environment\nSome programming languages need some sort of compiling done in order for them to run. If you use such language, Bit will make sure that the code you write will be able to build anywhere.\nDefine in bit.json the required build tool your code needs. Bit will use it to get all requirements so it can build it on any environment.\nThe build environment is a component with a set of requirements and an API for Bit to use.\nWhen you run bit build, Bit will download the build component and it's dependencies. Bit will use it to build your code within the scope. The outcome of this action will be a dist file that can run without any boilerplating.\nUsing Build Environment\nTo show how a build environment works, lets take this code, written in flow.\n/* @flow */\nmodule.exports = function isString(val: string): boolean {\n  return typeof val === 'string';\n};\n\nNow we can add the flow environment to the component's bit.json file.\n{\n    \"env\": {\n        \"compiler\": \"bit.envs/compilers/flow\"\n    }\n}\n\nand after running the bit build command, a dist.js file will be generated in component's folder:\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = function isString(val) {\n  return typeof val === 'string';\n};\n\nTesting Environment\nThere are many libraries designated to run test cases for code. Each developer chooses the one right for him.\nLike build environments, Bit also support another type of environments for running tests.\nWhen running bit test, Bit imports the configured test environments with its dependencies. Using the imported environment, Bit runs the tests. Bit gets the output from the test results, and outputs it to you.\nTo run tests Bit uses a Bit component which provides an API to run the test suite with the specific test tool.\nUsing Test Environment\nJust as build environment, a test environment is also defined in the component's bit.json file. However, to test a component you need to implement some tests for it.\nAdding tests to a component is very simple. Just create a file name spec in the component folder, implement, add the proper test environment to the bit.json file, and run using bit test \nFor example, lets implement tests for the isString code component from the privous example.\nAdd the following spec.js file:\nimport { expect } from 'chai';\n\nconst isString = require(__impl__);\n\ndescribe('#isString()', () => {\n  it('should return true if `foo` is passed', () => {\n    expect(isString('foo')).to.equal(true);\n  });\n});\n\nAnd the following test environment to bit.json\n{\n    \"env\": {\n        \"compiler\": \"bit.envs/compilers/flow\",\n        \"tester\": \"bit.envs/testers/mocha\"\n    }\n}\n\nNow run the tests using bit test , and see the results summary.\n› bit test -i is-string\ntests passed\ntotal duration - 4ms\n\n✔   #isString() should return true if `foo` is passed - 1ms\n\nWriting Environments\nBit does not contain build or test libraries. So you need to extend it to support your specific programming language and tooling. What you need to do is to implement a component designed to build or test using a specific library. Use a scope to host it, so you can reuse it later as a dependency for other components.\n"},"bit-scope.html":{"url":"bit-scope.html","title":"Bit Scope","keywords":"","body":"Bit Scope\nWhat is a Bit Scope?\nBit's Scope is one of the fundamental entities of Bit. A Scope is a dynamic codebase responsible to end-to-end management of code components.\nScopes are where components are stored, tested, built and integrate with each other.\nThe Scope's distributed nature is meant to enable teams to create scopes for every different level of abstraction inside the organization.\nFor example, a team in an organization may want\nEach component belongs in a scope (or multiple scopes). therefore, the scope's name appears in the component's ID path (which consists of owner/scope/box/component).\nComponent Store\nBit stores all components with version in a content-addressable filesystem.\nThis enables Bit to...\n// TODO\nDependency Management\nBit's dependency resolution and management was especially designed for the use code components.\nTherefore, we designed its dependency management mechanism with few relevent and major constraints in mind:\n\nInstallation (import) performance - To make \nPredictable and deterministic - The same dependencies will be installed at the same exact version, anywhere and acoross every machine to avoid dependency hell and deep dependency debugging.\nComponent availability - components should be made always available \n\nWhen you build a new component, you can add as many dependencies as you need in the bit.json file.\nThe bit export command will ensure the component will be packaged with all its dependencies.\nWhen bit push is issued, the new component, with all its dependencies, will all be uploaded to the scope.\nOnce a component is pushed to a scope, the receiving scope will try to build and test the component to ensure it is, in fact, isolated.\nbit import will download the component with all of its dependencies in a single call.\nThe benefits of on-export dependency resolution.\n\nFast build time - When your application builds Bit does nothing but simply downloading a flat list of dependencies. That's it. Bit doesn’t have a dependency tree, so no need for recalculating and downloading more dependencies. This means a faster build time. \nReliability - Since every component is stored with its dependencies, in a tested version to work with, you can be sure it will keep working in any new environment regardless of any changes made to its dependencies (even if deleted).\nNo duplications - Bit knows what are the exact dependencies it needs to grab, so if there are any duplications, it will simply download a single working copy. \n\nScope CI\nBit comes with a built-in slim CI mechanism.\n// TODO\nDiscoverability\nOne of the biggest problems for developers today is being able to find and reuse existing code components. Bit was created with exactly this problem in mind, so we place high importance on component discoverability.\nBit has an internal search engine capable of searching all the scopes connected to your computer. This search engine can be accessed from your CLI so you can access external resources without leaving your development environment. The search engine works by indexing components along with their documentation and querying them using fuzzy search techniques like abbreviations and stemming. This allows more flexibility when searching components, because you don’t have to remember exactly how you called your component in order to easily retrieve it.\nThe paradigm of keeping your code components in small packages also facilitates discoverability. Normally, while writing and maintaining packages, you need to have a README file that explains the whole project to other developers.

To do so, you will need to set up a remote server to do any collaboration on bit components (well, to be techincally correct - you can import/export components directory from individual scopes, but it will not scale).\nThe best collaboration method is to set up a remote scope that all the consumers will have access to import and export component from. In this section, we'll refer to the 'remote scope' as 'bit server'. However, you will notice that the amount of resources used by a remote scope is so small, that you rarely need an entire server for it.\nTo set up a bit server you will need to decide on the type of protocol you need. Currently bit supports 2 protocols, which you will need to choose between them, according to your workflow. Then use this simple guide to run the commands required to create and connect the bit server.\nDue to the fact that a bit server in used only as a collaboration tool, a bit server is basicaly a bare repository. Meaning a bit scope with no working directory.\nProtocols\nBit currently supports 2 types of communication protocol, for the scopes to communicate with each other. Local and SSH.\nEach protocol has it's own use cases, and here you'll learn when to use which. \nLocal Protocol\nBit's local protocal is based on accessing folders and files in your local file system. This means that a bit server which uses the local protocol will not be accesible for users that want to connect to the bit server from outside of the machine. So using this protocol is best for local work only, such as evaluating bit or developing it.\nTo use it, simply connect to the bit server by using this command:\nbit remote add file://///\n\nSSH Protocol\nA common transport protocol for Bit when self-hosting is over SSH. This is because SSH access to servers is already set up in most places – and if it isn’t, it’s easy to do. SSH is also an authenticated network protocol; and because it’s ubiquitous, it’s generally easy to set up and use.\nThis makes SSH to be the prefered way for collaboration when developing components to remote scopes.\nTo add a bit server over SSH, run this command:\nbit remote add ssh://bit-server:////\n\nSetting up a server\nIn this section we'll explain how to use a remote server to setup as many scopes as needed.\nPrerequisites\n\n*nix server.\nUser for bit (with with .ssh and authorized_keys, for remote workflow).\n\nCreate a remote scope\nOnce you have all prerequisites, the one thing left is to run the bit init command with the --bare flag, to create a scope without a working directory.\nsu bit\nmkdir /opt/bit\ncd /opt/bit\nmkdir first-scope\ncd first-scope\nbit init --bare\n\nNow add your own pulic SSH key to the authorized_keys list of the user bit. This will allow you to import and export components hosted in first-scope.\nLet's add our first-scope as a remote scope to a newly create local scope on our development machine. I'll assume that our server is named bit-server, for the sake of this example.\nmkdir my-project\nbit init\nbit remote add ssh://bit-server:/opt/bit/first-scope\nbit create hello-world\nbit commit hello-world 'testing remote'\nbit export @this/hello-world first @first-scope\n\nNotice that when working with scopes, you need to prepand the scope's name with @. Also not that when working with youe local scope, you can use @this to tell bit you are doing actions on it, and not on remote scopes.\nGenerating your SSH public key\nThese docs will describe the process of creating SSH key pair for Unix, seeing that it's a similar process across all operating systems.\n\nUse this command to generate a new SSH key pair\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n\nView the content of ~/.ssh directory, and look for a pair of files named id_rsa and id_rsa.pub.\n\nCopy the content of the id_rsa.pub, and add it to your server's authorized_keys.\n\n\n"},"bit-internals.html":{"url":"bit-internals.html","title":"Bit Internals","keywords":"","body":"Bit internals\nBit Objects\n//TODO\nJSDoc parsing\nParsing the Docs yield useful information, such as the description of the component, its arguments, return type and usage examples.\nOther parts of the system, the Search, in particular, use that information for a better understanding what a component does.\nThe JSDoc get discovered by a Regex pattern, and parsing the docs is done by Doctrine.\n"},"glossary.html":{"url":"glossary.html","title":"Glossary","keywords":"","body":"Glossary\nThe glossary defines the various Bit entities and explains the relationship between them.\n\nComponent\nComponent id\nFull id\nInline id\n\n\nScope\nLocal Scope\nRemote Scope\n\n\nScope network\nBox (namespace)\ninline_components\ncomponents directory\nbit.json\nProject bit.json\nComponent bit.json\n\n\nEnvironment\nBuild environment\nCompiler\nTest environment\nTester\n\n\n\nComponent\nA code component is the smallest atomic functionality that handles a single responsibility.\nIt can be a anything, for example function, class, object, array, string etc ...\nSmall components can be composed together, creating a greater functionality.\nA Bit component consists of one file that includes the implementation: impl.js.\nIt can also contain two additional (recommended) files:\n\nspec.js - contains the component's unit tests.\n\nbit.json - contains dependencies, description, environments etc.\n\n\nComponent id\nThere are two types of ids.\nFull id\nConsists of //::, used in bit.json dependencies, compiler and tester fields.\nWhen you want to refer to a component located in a bit scope, you have to use the full id.\nInline id\nConsists of /.\nWhen you want to refer to a component located in the inline_components, you have to use the inline id.\nYou can also use the inline id to refer the components from your code. bit('array/sort')\nScope\nA scope is a collection of boxes and components.
